# Deforestation_Analysis

In the project I used satellite images of forests and analyzed them to track the loss of forest cover. I processed multiple images and compared them to determine the extent of deforestation. To achieve this, I utilized the Opencv library for image analysis and processing, as well as the Matplotlib and Numpy libraries for data visualization. Through this project, I gained experience in image analysis, data visualization, and working with environmental data.
